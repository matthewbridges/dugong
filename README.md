RHINO DUGONG
======
DUGONG is an Architecture designed for the RHINO Platform. It is coded in VHDL and is designed to comply with the
Wishbone B4 Bussing Standard. The Aim of this project is aid people in implementing ASIC prototypes on the RHINO, 
however, it was mainly designed with DSP applications in mind.
